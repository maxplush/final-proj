TODO:

* doctests + PEP8style guide

* (done) Integrate text to image generation for each chapter
    * integrate LUMA Dream API

* Prompt Improvments:
    * Generate potential Q and A's for to the prompt sent to groq(for formating)
    * Ask for citations or direct references: Encourage the LLM to refer explicitly to the memoir text 
    (e.g., "Where does the memoir mention this?").
    * (I think I already did this) Use controlled prompts: “Only use the memoir for your response; avoid adding extra information.”

* Select which chapter's I will use to publish this project then --> 
    * Create spec list of questions we will aim to answer (given those chapters)

Other Potential Improvments
* Voice Interaction (speech-to-text and text-to-speech)
* Streamlit UI
* Personalized System Prompts (Example Use Case: A slider in the interface that switches between "Serious Scholar" and "Casual Friend.")
* Add Cultural or Historical Context (external APIs like Wikipedia's API to fetch related historical or cultural information based on keywords from the memoir.)

Goal is to create a good project incorperate the use of LLMS

focus on the problem that I'm trying to solve

LLM is not used for search but for summarization 

Mike feedback:
Adding Guardrails
- You could try to design the prompt to encourage the model to explicitly say it doesn't know the answer to story telling questions. (Perhaps giving it a list of examples of questions that it shouldn't try to answer, and other questions that it should try to answer.)
-Having a separate model first check to see if the question is appropriate, and then only trying to answer the question if the first model thinks it's appropriate.
-You could encourage the model (via the prompt) to interleave quotes and references (e.g. page numbers) into it's reply. LLMs tend to be good at quoting and referencing material that is included in their prompt (e.g. via rag). The reputation of LLMs to hallucinate references is when they are trying to reference something that is not included in the prompt, but only included in the original training data, which is not your use case.
- silo the different documents into "memoir", "other stories"
- data table could be "paragraph", "summary page", "summary chapter"
- then prompt RAG with 
    - DOC 1:
        Summary chapter: _____
        Summmary page: _____
        Paragraph: _____

# taoist qoutes

 The user's question is not provided, but based on the content of Chapter 17 of the memoir, here are some possible answers to hypothetical questions:

* When did the author go on the hiking trip to the Grand Canyon? The author mentions it was during their junior year, around 1982.
* Who organized the hiking trip? The trip was organized by the author's friend Wolf, who secured a special permit for the group to hike off the main trail.
* What happened on the seventh day of the trip? The author got separated from the rest of the group and had to find their way back, which took several hours.
* What did the author use as a means of starting a fire to signal for help? The author's lighter was used to start a fire to signal for help.
* Why did the author decide against using the fire to signal for help? The author chose not to use the fire because they were concerned about the potential damage it could cause and nearly incinerating themselves.
* What did the author see when they reached a clearing after running for several hours? The author saw a group of hikers in the distance, about 50 yards above them.
* Why was the author furious with Wolf? The author was furious because Wolf had allowed the group to continue hiking without all members, despite knowing that this was a serious risk.
* What did the author and the rest of the group do after stopping at a local eatery? The author and the rest of the group used the restroom, and to save water, they did not flush the toilets.
