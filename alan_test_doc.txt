Chapter 5 - Jones Beach Undertow
Mom loaded up the 1960 Pontiac Lemans, steel-belted radials, 4-door automatic, bronze metallic; it was sharp, even back then. Bedsheet, lunch, drinks, snacks, Frisbee, fresh bathing suits, Johnson's Baby Powder to get the sand off, pails and shovels, and off we went. West End 2, next stop. Grand Central Parkway to Meadowbrook, toll to the beach, my Mom’s lead foot weighing heavily on the gas. No car seats then, and no seatbelts! Me and my little sister, standing in the back seat, heads bobbing in and out of the wide open windows. We couldn’t wait to hit the ocean. But first, my Mom took out her trusty bottle of Johnson’s baby oil and iodine concoction and slather herself from head to toe, before she comfortably eased back into her nylon webbed beach chair with her trusty reflector, its strength doubled by a layer of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil. 
We each took a corner of the bedsheet, pulled it tight and cupped the corners into the sand for a firm hold.
Off I went to the water, dove in and swam out, my sister by the shore line, pail and shovel in hand. Before I knew it, the lifeguard was blowing his whistle, waving his arms, summoning all swimmers to come to the shore. I tried to swim but was caught in a major undertow/riptide. I swallowed water and thought I was going to drown. I could barely keep my head up. I saw the lifeguard dive into the water. Next thing I knew his arm was around me. “You’re okay. You’re okay,” he assured me, as he swam me back to safety. It was sandcastles with my little sister for the rest of the day. 
Chapter 13 - Dead End
I always worked as a young man. In high school I shoveled snow every winter. After learning the ropes from the Peterfriends, a neighborhood couple who had a booth of their own selling knock off sweatshirts, I ran my own booth at the Roosevelt Raceway flea market. I also worked at my local fruit and vegetable store on Union Turnpike and worked as a painter for a commercial painting company. I also ran freight elevators at 150 and 148 Nassau Street in NYC and thoroughly enjoyed each job.
 I was painting a parking garage during the big blackout of ’77. I could hear the rioting and screaming going on outside the garage doors, it was pitch black. I was all alone and it was 3am so I decided it would be safer to sleep here, which I did, making it home safely the next morning. I always enjoyed working for myself.
My friend Alex and l took every precaution meeting with the supplier less than a block from my house on Kingsbury Avenue, at the dead end, off the bicycle path, during the day. We got into the client's car which was parked facing the bicycle path, me in the front seat next to the driver, Alex in the back behind the driver with a passenger the driver had brought along.
We were going to discuss and purchase over a thousand B.V.D. colored pocket t-shirts. We assumed the shirts were in the trunk and we began to talk about the deal when the driver pulled out a butcher knife from under a dirty rag. He jabbed into my ribs on my left side. Fortunately, I was wearing my brown leather bomber jacket and it only slightly broke my skin. He said give me the money. I yelled go Alex! At the same time I punched the driver in the face.
I swung open the door and at the same time the rear seat passenger got out with a gun and took aim at Alex while he was running towards the bike path. I pushed the gunman to the ground. He had not seen me coming, and then ran onto the bike path and then home, careful not to be followed. I would not enter the textile business until years later in my 20's working for a company called Reminiscence in NYC.  
Chapter 16 - Car Crash/Grand Prix Grand Central Parkway 
It was summer, Saturday night; my parents were away on vacation, probably some tropical island. I was heading out to a bar to see a live rock band on Long Island, planning to meet my sister, Rhonda, and some of her friends later on. I was very fortunate that my parents allowed me to use their mint condition, ’78 Grand Prix with a sunroof. I washed it every weekend. I kept that car spotless. I backed out of our driveway onto Kingsbury Avenue, headed to Springfield Boulevard, took a right at the stop, onto Union Turnpike, made a left at the light and proceeded to the entrance of the Grand Central Parkway, heading east. I had gotten to this entrance hundreds of times, however, this early summer evening was quite different.
Not wearing my seatbelt, and being only 20 years old, what harm could come to me?!
With my foot on the gas, merging into traffic, I made my way into the far left lane. An erratic, possibly drunk driver trying to pass me cut me off, forcing me to swerve into the metal and concrete divider. The car was totaled, smashed into an accordion. Amazingly, I was still alive. My bones didn’t hurt. I could move my arms and legs. I didn’t see any blood. However, the steering wheel was jammed into my gut and ribcage. If it hadn’t been for that I would have gone through the windshield. Fortunately I managed to free myself and climb out through the sunroof.  In a state of shock I sat down next to the car. Traffic flowed east and west. Seconds later Rhonda appeared. Was I dreaming? She was on her way to meet me when she saw the car. We embraced. Tears flowed. “I thought you were dead,” she said.
An ambulance and the police arrived on the scene.The EMTs checked me out and I refused to be taken to the hospital. I told the police my address and they had the car towed there. It wasn’t until the following morning when I saw the mangled car in the driveway that reality set it. Oh my God! I thought. My parents are going to freak out.
Besides the loss of the vehicle, if they saw the state of the car in the driveway before they saw that I, Rhonda, and our youngest sister, Leslie, were unharmed, they would imagine the worst. I couldn’t let that happen. Quick thinker that I was, I called the neighborhood mechanic, someone I believed I could trust and asked him if he could pick up the car and take it to his shop, with the understanding he was not to work on the car. The car was obviously beyond repair, the frame clearly bent in several places. Ignoring my request, he took it upon himself to milk the insurance company and try to repair the car. My Grand Prix was no longer grand. It never drove the same again.
A few days passed, the doorbell rang, and there were my tanned and smiling parents back from their relaxing trip in the tropics. My mom knew something was up because instead of my usual everyday attire of blue jeans and T shirt, there I was at the door in suit and tie.
“Alan, what happened? Where’s the car?”
Being the understanding parents I raised them to be, after hearing the story they were just happy I was okay.
Chapter 17 - Grand Canyon
The Aspen leaves were a brilliant shade of yellow. The air was crisp as it was every morning in Ft. Collins, Colorado. It was winter break and I was in my Junior year. I had just sold my Triumph TR6 to my local mechanic and I was headed to the Grand Canyon with a group of friends on a hiking trip for two weeks. My good friend Wolf organized the trip. He was able to secure a special permit to go hiking off the main trail. These permits were only issued to experienced hikers of the Grand Canyon. Eight of us set off on the trail without incident, spending days talking, exploring, and taking in the beauty of God's glorious creation.
On the seventh day we decided to head deep into the canyon. We took a break and then, noticing the time, decided to head back up the canyon to find a safe place to camp for the night. We were all spread out along the trail and when I looked up my heart pounded in fear. There was not a soul in sight. The other hiker had gone ahead without me. I was terrified. It had been made clear to us all that if you became lost or couldn’t find your way back from this particular trail, you would never be found. Hikers had died from exposure, starvation, dehydration, and accidents. I knew that if I did not find the rest of the team in a few minutes they would be gone, maybe forever. I riffled through my backpack and found my lighter. I could start a huge fire in hopes someone would spot it and I would be found. I thought long and hard. Sweat poured from my brow. On one hand I could be rescued, but on the other, the damage I would do would be catastrophic and possibly incinerate myself in the process. I gathered my strength, cleared my head and was determined to find the trail and forget about the fire. I ran through dirt, through  rocks and brush, looking for the trail, my face, arms and legs, cut from branches. On and on I ran, my legs aching, my heart pounding, when all of a sudden, I reached a clearing. I stopped, hands on knees till my breathing returned to normal, when I looked up, and a football field length above me, I met a group of hikers. I couldn’t make out their faces. I yelled and waved my arms.  “Wait. Wait.” They looked down, waved back and continued walking, but at a slower pace. I spotted another hiker about 50 yards ahead of me, and I kept my eyes fixed on his back, as I continued my way up the rock-faced side of the mountain. I was not going to die after all. At that moment I lost all respect for Wolf. There was no excuse, no justification for directing the hiking party to continue without all members. I was furious. You think you know someone. I knew Wolf for several years, and thought of him as an honest, straightforward, decent human being, one who I was able to confide in and talk about the future and bond over our Jewish heritage. I trusted him implicitly.
When we were all gathered on top of the mountain and I confronted him, all I heard were excuses. You were too far behind. You were taking your time. I thought you wanted to hike by yourself. Everyone wants to proceed at a faster pace … Excuses.
Chapter 19 - Motorcycle Crash/Denver, Colorado


I graduated from Colorado State University in 1983 and moved back to Denver in 1985, where I sold new and used cars at Bob Bundy AMC Jeep and Renault. After much success I opened my own wholesale car business proudly named Plush Motors, where I would buy and sell cars at auction and occasionally rebuild classic cars. Having bought two motorcycles in high school and teaching myself to ride and loving it, I always had my eye out for a new bike. A fully licensed biker, I was eager to compliment my refurbished Triumph TR4A convertible with removable hardtop, I was eager to get my hands on a new two wheeler. Always intrigued by the mystique of Harley Davidson, I contemplated a new or used Fat Boy.
Boy was I surprised when my old boss from the apartment complex I was helping to manage, stopped by and asked me to take a ride and check out a certain car he had his eye on. Ten minutes later I was in front of a Yamaha motorcycle dealership. Come on inside and take a look, he said. He knew I was looking for a bike. I was quite perplexed and couldn’t imagine what was on his mind. “Look around and see what you like,” he said. I was beginning to feel that this was my lucky day. I put Harley Davidson out of my mind and not wanting to be too greedy I didn’t focus on the most expensive bike. I settled on a bright red and white Yamaha 550 Induro, street legal, but equipped for dirt trails and roads, ideal for the hills of Colorado. I said smugly, “That one looks pretty good.” He said, “It’s yours, pulled out his checkbook, wrote out the full amount, temporary tags were slapped on the bike, and off I went. “What is it for? Why?” I asked. “It’s for all the good work and advice you have given me,” he said, and off I went.
I rode the bike for months, highways, dirt trails, round trips to Colorado Springs, high revving and a lot of fun, till one fateful evening, on the way home from a local eatery. A warm summer rain was coming down, the street poorly lit and unfamiliar. Colorado did not have a helmet law at the time, and I seldom wore mine, but this night was different from all other nights and I had mine on, however the straps unfastened. If not for my helmet I might not be alive today.
The engine revved, first, second, third gear, I was doing 50 before I knew it. Not a smart move, I daresay I was reckless of the peril that I was about to face. In a split second, I had to decide whether to crash head on into a solid wood fence or lay the bike down. I chose the latter and laid the bike on its left side. As I fell I remembered the safest thing to do in a cash is to spread your arms and legs outward, and not to force a long damaging tumble where one can roll and break apart. I did so, landing on the back of my head, the helmet saving my life. The helmet being unfastened fell off my head. I took a couple of tumbles and rolled over two or three times and landed on the front yard of a nearby home. A nice elderly couple ran out and asked if I was okay. Severely shaken and badly bruised, thank God I was okay. A few weeks later after much contemplation I sold my bike.
