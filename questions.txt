Potential Questions:

- Summary and Contextual Questions
Best for overviews and context, ensuring the LLM stays within the bounds of the memoir.
Examples:
"Summarize the main events in Chapter 3 of the memoir."
"What are the key challenges described during [specific time period/event]?"
"How does the author describe their relationship with [person/place] in the memoir?"


- Detailed Content Extraction
Ask for specific details that are verifiable within the memoir.

"Describe the author's experience during [specific event]."
"what sports did alan like?"
"Where and when was alan born?"

- Comparative or Analytical Questions (not sure about this)
Encourage the LLM to draw inferences based solely on the memoir’s content.
Examples:
"How does the author’s perspective on [topic] change over the course of the memoir?"
"What are the differences between the author's early career and their later career, as described in the memoir?"
"Compare the descriptions of [specific person/place] to others in the memoir."

- Quotations and Specific Text Retrieval
Ask for verbatim quotes or paraphrased insights from particular sections.
Examples:
"What did the author say about [specific person/event]?"
"Provide a direct quote from the memoir about [specific event]."
"What metaphors or similes does the author use to describe [place/experience]?"

- Clarification and Explanatory Questions
Request explanations or elaborations for complex parts of the memoir.
Examples:
"What does the author mean by '[specific phrase]' in Chapter 4?"
"Explain the significance of [specific event/person] in the memoir."
"Why was [specific event] a turning point in the author's life?"
